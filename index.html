        Ozone , or trioxygen, is an inorganic molecule with the chemical formula O
        3. It is a pale blue gas with a distinctively pungent smell. It is an allotrope of oxygen
        that is much less stable than the diatomic allotrope O
        2, breaking down in the lower atmosphere to O
        2 (dioxygen). Ozone is formed from dioxygen by the action of ultraviolet (UV)
        light and electrical discharges within the Earth's atmosphere. It is present in very
        low concentrations throughout the latter, with its highest concentration high in the ozone layer
        of the stratosphere,which absorbs most of the Sun's ultraviolet (UV) radiation.
